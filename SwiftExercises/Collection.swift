/// that object, you'll break the tree. It would be better to use (and return) a copy.
/// Since swift classes do not extend a universal base class (e.g. Object), there's no
/// way to programmatically determine if something is a value type or a reference type
/// in a generic. You can say "someObject is AnyClass" but that evaluates true for
/// structs as well. Since there's no exception mechanism, you can't try to modify it
/// and catch the error at runtime, either. In order to make findMatchOf optional,
/// it has to go into an @objc base protocol, but it can't be generic in that case
/// (no typealiases are allowed, so the argument and return have to be AnyObject),
//  so you'll loose type safety.
